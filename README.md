# Stream v2

Created using `create-react-app`.

`yarn start` or `npm run start` to run locally.

`yarn build` or `npm run build` to compile.

To deploy current state of the app to GitHub Pages, run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`. Notice that after it you might have to go to https://github.com/streamproject/stream-2/settings and under GitHub Pages add `streamtoken.net` in order to reconnect custom domain settings. Will look into this issue later.

This `README.md` file is to be extended.
